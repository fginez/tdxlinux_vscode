Toradex Embedded Linux SDK integrated to vscode environment

This repository is my base setup to start a project within VS Code using my own generated Toradex Yocto SDK.
It's "inspired" on VARISCITE wiki on "https://variwiki.com/index.php?title=Yocto_Programming_with_VSCode&release=RELEASE_HARDKNOTT_V1.0_DART-MX8M-MINI"
